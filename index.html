      Diving into a new algorithm can often feel overwhelming, with its myriad terms and equations. But it doesnâ€™t have
      to be that way. With the interactive potential of modern websites, we can transform learning experiences from
      static and daunting to dynamic and engaging.

    </p>

    <p>
      One such algorithm is the differential growth algorithm. While there are several excellent blog posts explaining
      its mechanics (thanks to <a href="https://medium.com/@jason.webb/2d-differential-growth-in-js-1843fd51b0ce">Jason
        Webb</a> and <a href="https://inconvergent.net/2016/shepherding-random-growth/">Inconvergent</a>), I felt there
      was a missing element of playfulness. The parameters of this algorithm are much easier to understand when you can
      see their effects in real-time rather than just reading about them. This inspired me to create an explorable
      explanation of the differential growth algorithm.
    </p>

    <p>
      To facilitate this interactive learning, I have prepared a playground where you can adjust the parameters and
      immediately observe their effects. This hands-on approach can demystify the algorithm and make the learning
      process more intuitive and enjoyable.
    </p>

    <p>
      The differential growth algorithm revolves around four main parameters:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li><b>Alignment Force:</b> Each node applies a force to maintain a straight line with its connected nodes,
        promoting orderly growth.</li>
      <li><b>Repulsion Force:</b> Each node applies a force to keep a distance from other nodes, preventing
        overcrowding.</li>
      <li><b>Repulsion Radius: </b>This defines the detection radius within which the repulsion force is applied to
        other nodes.</li>
      <li><b>Node Distance:</b> This parameter governs the behavior based on node proximity. If nodes are closer than
        the minimum distance, they merge into one node. Conversely, if nodes are farther apart than the maximum
        distance, a new node is created between them.</li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Try experimenting with these parameters in the interactive playground to see how each one influences the
      algorithm's behavior. This way, you can grasp the concepts more effectively than through static explanations
      alone.
